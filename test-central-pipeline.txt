Testing central pipeline after permissions fix for Repository Dispatch

This test file validates that:
- Repository Dispatch triggers correctly for docs changes
- Central pipeline processes docs-changed events  
- Commit status updates to success (if deployment impact detected)
- PR becomes mergeable

Timestamp: 2025-09-18T20:27:30Z
Fix applied: DISPATCH_TOKEN permissions for cross-repo status updates

Note: Docs trigger only activates for deployment-impacting changes
